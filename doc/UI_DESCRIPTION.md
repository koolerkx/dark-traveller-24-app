Users enter their team name to log in. It uses the `useAuth` hook to handle authentication and redirects to `/home` on success.                                                  |
| **Login Success Toast** | <img src="./assets/ui_login_success_toast.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the Login success toast message" width="384"> | A confirmation toast message that appears at the bottom of the screen after a successful login.                                                                                                                      |

| **Map**                 | <img src="./assets/ui_map.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the Map view with points" width="384">                        | An interactive map powered by Leaflet.js. It uses `pointRepository.getPointsWithCapturedInfo()` to display all checkpoints with status-based markers (e.g., new, captured, expired).                                 |
| **Map Point Detail**    | <img src="./assets/ui_map_point_detail.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the Map point detail modal" width="384">         | A modal that appears when a user taps a marker on the map.

It uses the device's camera to scan checkpoint or upgrade QR codes. On a successful scan, it calls the appropriate method in the `userRepository` (`capturePoint` or `upgradeUser`). |
| **Scan Success**        | <img src="./assets/ui_scan_success.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the Scan success message" width="384">               | A confirmation alert that appears after a successful scan, informing the user that they have captured a point or upgraded their level.                                                                               |
| **Ranking**             | <img src="./assets/ui_ranking.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the team leaderboard" width="384">                        | Displays the team leaderboard.

It displays the user's rank, level, and lists of their currently active and recently expired points using the `ProfileInfoCard` and `ProfilePointList` components.              |
| **PWA Installation**    | <img src="./assets/ui_pwa.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the PWA installation prompt" width="384">                     | The browser prompt that allows the user to install the web application to their device's home screen for a native-like experience.                                                                                   |
